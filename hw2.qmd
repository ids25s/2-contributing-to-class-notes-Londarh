# Working on Homework Problems  
  + a. **What are the differences between binary and source files?**

The binary files are pdf, html, jpg; source files are python, ipynb, qmd files.
Source files are basically where you write the code, and binary files can 
sometimes be compiled from the source files.

  + b. **Why do we not want to track binary files in a repo?**

We do not want to track binary files in a repo, because they can be always compiled from
source files. Moreover, every change in source does change the binary, making it 
unpractical and excessive to have them in a repo.

  + c. **Why do I require pdf output via release?**

Because it makes the work of a grader easier: they do not have to clone
the repo to their PC all the time, and just go to releases tab.

  + d. **Why do I not want your files added via ‘upload’?**

Because we need to practice git and command line interface,
so we should push files and not 'upload' them.

  + e. **Why do I require line width under 80?**

Because it is easier to see the changes made to the code (`git diff`),
while proposing the changes to main repo.

  + f. **Why is it not a good idea to have spaces in file/folder names?**

It requires extra time and characters, when you write code which has a file name in it.
For example, `cd "file path"` or `git add "file name"` is easier to write when the
name of the file does not have spaces in it, or you will have to always add " ",
indicating that this is actually single word.

# Contributing to the class notes
**a. Create a fork of the notes repo into your own GitHub account.**

  + Firstly, we need to go to HuskyCT -> STAT 3255, and open syllabus. 
  + Go to the classnotes link, then go to the github repo using link, provided in the classsnotes. 
  + Now we are at GitHub. Click *"fork"* button and create a fork of a repo to your account.

**b. Clone it to an appropriate folder on your computer.**

  + Go to your GitHub account and find the forked repo. Copy the SSH key
  + Now go to an appropriate folder on PC and type `git clone "paste SSH"` in VS Code.
